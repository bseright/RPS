This is an animated of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

What I learned doing this project: 

- manipulating the DOM based on user interactions
- creating animations to be added/removed with js
- allowing elements to be moved off-screen without expanding the viewing window
- utilizing the setTimeout function for seamless animation
- basic design to direct the user without explicitly giving directions
- reusing images with filters to serve other functions
